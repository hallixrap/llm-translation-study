Chemotherapy for Cancer

Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment that uses medicines to destroy cancer cells. Chemo is used to treat many types of cancer, but not everyone who has cancer will get chemo.

How does chemo work?

Chemo works by harming cancer cells in order to destroy them. It can also harm some normal, healthy cells, too. That is because chemo affects cells that are quickly growing and dividing. But, normal cells will usually get better or be replaced with new, healthy cells after some time.

How is chemo given?

Many types of chemo are given as an infusion through an IV catheter that is put into a vein. Other types can be given as a shot or injection, taken as a pill, or applied to the skin. Chemo can be the only treatment that's needed for some cancers. Or, sometimes it can be given with other treatments like surgery, radiation, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy.

Where do people go to get chemo?

Chemo is often given in an outpatient clinic or treatment center. For certain chemo treatments, a person might need to stay in the hospital for a day or so. Some types of chemo can be taken at home.

How often is chemo given, and how long does it last?

Because each person's treatment is different, how often chemo is given and how long it lasts can be different, too.

Chemo is often given in cycles. This means the chemo is given and then followed by a period of rest. This period of rest allows the body to recover from side effects before the next treatment is due.

For example, chemo might be given for one or more days during a week, followed by a couple weeks of rest. The number of days or weeks a cycle lasts can be different and depends on the type of chemo that's given. The number of chemo cycles given can be different, too.

Getting ready for chemo

If chemo is part of your treatment, talk to your cancer care team about what to expect. This will help you plan for changes in your work or family schedule if needed.

Side effects of chemo

Chemo harms some normal, healthy cells, which can cause side effects. Because side effects depend on the chemo that's given, not everyone getting chemo will have the same side effects. Some side effects might happen during or right after getting chemo, while others might happen after a few days, weeks, months, or years after treatment.

Some common side effects include:

• Nausea or vomiting
• Hair loss
• Diarrhea or constipation
• Feeling weak and tired
• Fever or chills
• Low blood cell counts that might put you at higher risk for infections or bleeding
• Changes in taste or appetite
• Skin problems
• Mouth pain or mouth sores
• Other problems, depending on the type of chemo you're getting
